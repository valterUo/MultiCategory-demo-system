Regardless, he does help her professionally, and through his opportunities, which are achieved through intimidation and fear, Ruth does quickly start to gain a name as a singer, which she is able to do because of her talent and despite Martys intimidation tactics. However, the greater her success, the more reliant she becomes on him. This becomes an issue in their relationship as she believes he can take her only so far before he becomes a liability, however he will never let her go that easily. The one person who tried and tries to get Ruth away from her unhappy life with Marty is Johnny Alderman, the musical advisor Marty hired for Ruth at the first gig he got for her, and who also loves Ruth himself.", "language": "English", "country": "USA", "awards": "Won 1 Oscar.

Col. Von Meyer is about to pass the secret of the weapon to Col. Noyoma, as Japan is still at war, and will use it to revenge their recent losses. However, Field Marshal Von Runzel arrives with precise orders to the contrary: the Japanese shall not have the secret weapon, for an underground Nazi ring is to use it later in another attempt to destroy all the Allied Nations, and conquer the world in a third Worl War. Von Meyer decides to create a diversion, and to offer the Japanese scientist and officers some evening entertainment at the German Officers Club. Thaler, the female German Officer, is to bring in a number of women - arrested on trumped up charges at the Shanghai University - dress them up, and force them to service the lusty Japanese officers.

In the end, the American plot is uncovered, the Germans and the Japanese start killing each others, and the fugitive American and Chinese spies. A number of people die in heroic gun-fights. Maya is going to defuse the bombs left in the wine cellar by the escaping Americans, so that the Japanese will get the secret weapon in the end.

{"title": "The Interrupters", "year": "2011", "rated": "UNRATED", "released": "12 Aug 2011", "runtime": "125 min", "genre": "Documentary, Crime", "director": "Steve James", "writer": "Alex Kotlowitz (New York Times magazine article)", "actors": "Tio Hardiman, Ameena Matthews, Toya Batey, Cobe Williams", "plot": "The Interrupters tells the moving and surprising stories of three Violence Interrupters who try to protect their Chicago communities from the violence they once employed. From acclaimed director Steve James and bestselling author Alex Kotlowitz, this film is an unusually intimate journey into the stubborn, persistence of violence in our cities. Shot over the course of a year out of Kartemquin Films, The Interrupters captures a period in Chicago when it became a national symbol for the violence in our cities. During that period, the city was besieged by high-profile incidents, most notably the brutal beating of Derrion Albert, a Chicago High School student, whose death was caught on videotape. The films main subjects work for an innovative organization, CeaseFire, which believes that the spread of violence mimics the spread of infectious diseases, and so the treatment should be similar: go after the most infected, and stop the infection at its source. The singular mission of the Violence Interrupters - who have credibility on the streets because of their own personal histories -- is to intervene in conflicts before they explode into violence. In The Interrupters, Ameena Matthews, whose father is Jeff Fort, one of the citys most notorious gang leaders, was herself a drug ring enforcer. But having children and finding solace in her Muslim faith pulled her off the streets and grounded her. In the wake of Derrion Alberts death, Ameena becomes a close confidante to his mother, and helps her through her grieving. Ameena, who is known among her colleagues for her fearlessness, befriends a feisty teenaged girl who reminds her of herself at that age. The film follows that friendship over the course of many months, as Ameena tries to nudge the troubled girl in the right direction. Cobe Williams, scarred by his fathers murder, was in and out of prison, until he had had enough. His family - particularly a young son - helped him find his footing. Cobe disarms others with his humor and his general good nature. His most challenging moment comes when he has to confront a man so bent on revenge that Cobe has to pat him down to make sure hes put away his gun. Like Ameena, he gets deeply involved in the lives of those he encounters, including a teenaged boy just out of prison and a young man from his old neighborhood whos squatting in a foreclosed home. Eddie Bocanegra is haunted by a murder he committed when he was seventeen. His CeaseFire work is a part of his repentance for what he did. Eddie is most deeply disturbed by the aftereffects of the violence on children, and so he spends much of his time working with younger kids in an effort to both keep them off the streets and to get support to those who need it - including a 16-year-old girl whose brother died in her arms. Soulful and empathic, Eddie, who learned to paint in prison, teaches art to children, trying to warn them of the debilitating trauma experienced by those touched by the violence. The Interrupters follows Ameena, Cobe and Eddie as they go about their work, and while doing so reveals their own inspired journeys of hope and redemption. The film attempts to make sense of what CeaseFires Tio Hardiman calls, simply, the madness.", "language": "English", "country": "USA", "awards": "9 wins & 16 nominations.", "poster": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MjM0ODcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg1MjIwNg@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "metascore": "86", "imdbrating": "7.5", "imdbvotes": "3,102", "imdbid": "tt1319744", "typeClass": "movie", "response": "True"}

The Israeli defense force, the Haganah, has received intelligence that Arab forces, Syria in particular, are employing former German Panzer commander General Gustav Schiller to train them in tank tactics against Israel. The Israelis also learn that General Schillers wife, Judith Auerbach Schiller, is a Jewish woman who was betrayed by her husband and was left to die in a concentration camp. Judith has survived the camp and is searching for her husband to exact revenge and to locate their son. The Haganah decides to find Judith and use her knowledge in order to locate the general, positively identify him and make him reveal the Syrian attack plans. Judith is smuggled into Israel and hidden in a kibbutz under the care of Haganah commander Aaron Stein. Life in the kibbutz is not easy for Judith, work is hard, safety is not guaranteed and she grows impatient and frustrated. Haganah leaders suggest to her that the British may have a file on her husband, like on most war criminals, and it may contain his latest whereabouts. However, this means Judith may have to ingratiate herself with the local British commander, Major Lawton, who has access to the files. When Major Lawton finally succumbs to the charms of sensual Judith he hands over the file to her. Unfortunately, General Gustav Schillers last whereabouts are in Damascus, Syria. The Israeli intelligence team decides to go into the lions den and try to capture the German General. Judith is asked to go along with the team, in order to identify the General, but she is only thinking of revenge.", "language": "English", "country": "Israel, UK, USA", "awards": "N/A", "poster": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTA0ODQwNTc4NjheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU1MDg5NTAx._V1_SX300.jpg", "metascore": "N/A", "imdbrating": "5.9", "imdbvotes": "159", "imdbid": "tt0060568", "typeClass": "movie", "response": "True"}

Idealistic Erin Gruwell is just starting her first teaching job, that as freshman and sophomore English teacher at Woodrow Wilson High School, which, two years earlier, implemented a voluntary integration program. For many of the existing teachers, the integration has ruined the school, whose previously stellar academic standing has been replaced with many students who will be lucky to graduate or even be literate. Despite choosing the school on purpose because of its integration program, Erin is unprepared for the nature of her classroom, whose students live by generations of strict moral codes of protecting their own at all cost. Many are in gangs and almost all know somebody that has been killed by gang violence. The Latinos hate the Cambodians who hate the blacks and so on. The only person the students hate more is Ms. Gruwell. It isnt until Erin holds an unsanctioned discussion about a recent drive-by shooting death that she fully begins to understand what shes up against. And it isnt until she provides an assignment of writing a daily journal - which will be not graded, and will remain unread by her unless they so choose - that the students begin to open up to her. As Erin tries harder and harder to have resources provided to teach properly (which often results in her needing to pay for them herself through working second and third jobs), she seems to face greater resistance, especially from her colleagues, such as Margaret Campbell, her section head, who lives by regulations and sees such resources as a waste, and Brian Gelford, who will protect his priviledged position of teaching the senior honors classes at all cost.

Attracted by Hugh Wiley, a gambler, from a nearby city, Naomi finally elopes with him and eventually becomes known as the gambling queen. The girls one ambition in life is to hoard up her wealth against the day when she shall lose her beauty and her popularity. Bancroft has plunged into religious work. He has become famous as an evangelist and has been trusted with the combination to the vault of the great tabernacle over which he presides. Learning this fact, Wiley inflames the mind of Naomi against Bancroft on the false ground that he has spurned her because of her life. He plans to have Naomi lure Bancroft to her gambling palace on a pretense, to overpower the minister while he is in there, steal the combination and loot the tabernacle. Furthermore, Wiley arranges to have the executive board of the tabernacle informed when the minister is in the gambling den, and to have the place raided by the police while he and his pal, McCarthy, rob the tabernacle. But the minister is too strong to succumb to the temptations of Naomi when he reaches her apartment, and his spiritual power wins the repentance of his temptress. Wiley, realizing that he is losing, springs upon Bancroft from behind and gets the combination away from him while his confederate alarms the police and the executive board according to the plan. But Naomi spirits the minister away through a secret passage, rushes to the tabernacle too late to prevent the robbery, and makes the great sacrifice of replacing the stolen money by her own ill-gotten hoard before the bewildered police and board officials arrive at the vault. In the final great moment of spiritual exaltation, Naomi has realized the greatness of Bancrofts love and of his power.

Of the twenty million people in Ghana, two million are disabled. This is the story of one disabled man whose mission-and purpose- is to change all that forever. In Emmanuels Gift, filmmakers Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern have uncovered a story as compelling as it is important. Narrated by Oprah Winfrey, the film chronicles the life of Emmanuel Ofosu Yeboah, a young Ghanaian man born with a severely deformed right leg, who today, against incalculable odds, is opening minds, hearts and doors-and effecting social and political change throughout his country. While Emmanuels message is vital: people with disabilities are valuable contributors to any society, his method is inspirational. Emmanuel begins his quest with a bicycle ride, over 600 kilometers, across Ghana with one leg-and continues to spread his vision with grit and resolve. Lisa Lax and Nancy Stern have been documenting Emmanuels plight for over a year, having shot over 100 hours of powerful imagery. The film includes original footage shot in Ghana, California, Oregon and New York, as well as photographs and other acquired film/video of Emmanuels early years. Through it all, they have created an intimate insight into the mind and heart of a visionary whose unforgettable journey transcends continents and cultures and becomes each of ours to share.", "language": "English", "country": "USA", "awards": "N/A", "poster": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1ODIwNDE0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjgyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "metascore": "61", "imdbrating": "7.7", "imdbvotes": "167", "imdbid": "tt0447016", "typeClass": "movie", "response": "True"}

Griffith", "actors": "George Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson, Charles Inslee, Harry Solter", "plot": "John and Tom Wilkins are brothers and most divergent in natures. John is a clergyman and a noble, upright fellow, while Tom is a scapegrace, wild, reckless and unscrupulous. Not having the parental guidance so essential in youth, his father being dead and his mother blind, he drifted into bad company, the contaminating influence deeply affecting his susceptible nature. Despite the earnest pleading of his brother John he sank lower in morass of transgression, spending most of his time at the ale house drinking and at cards. All this John has succeeded in keeping from his dear mother, whose blindness is almost a blessing, for a mother would rather her eyes be sightless than to view the indiscretions of her loved ones. So she possessed the blissful impression that her boys were both paragons of righteousness. Gods mercy is unfailing; you will admit this Divine Charity. In the village there dwelt, as neighbors to Wilkins, Farmer Tobias and his wife, and their daughter, Gladys. Tom and Gladys grew up together, and were child sweethearts, which grew stronger with Gladys as time went on. So deeply did she love the handsome Tom that she put her entire trust in him, feeling sure that he would reciprocate her sacrificial devotion with the honorable obligation it merited. But, oh, how mistaken she was, and only after prayers and tearful entreaties does he agree to marry her, and then only upon condition that she elope. To this she consents most reluctantly, for which act she is disowned by her parents. The villainy that is wrapped up in the black heart of Tom. Truly a marriage ceremony is performed, but it is by a rowdy friend of Toms, disguised as a clergyman, in fact, a mock marriage. For a time Gladys lived in ignorance of the truth, but it at last came out when Tom deserts her. Back to her home she trudged carrying her infant, and at the door she is met by her mother with open arms but when the father appears, he, still obdurate, drives her away. She then goes to John Wilkins, and tells her sad story. He calls Tom and demands he make immediate reparation. Tom treats the matter lightly and the brothers are on the verge of blows when the blind mother, like a ministering angel, appears, and Toms heart is at last softened. He takes Gladys and their child to his bosom, while they receive the benediction bestowed by their priestly brother.", "language": "English", "country": "USA", "awards": "N/A", "poster": "N/A", "metascore": "N/A", "imdbrating": "6.3", "imdbvotes": "7", "imdbid": "tt0000720", "typeClass": "movie", "response": "True"}

A broken foot necessitates that he be put ashore to heal. After his recovery, the very proud Jim - his pride rooted in his competence, which had made him a highly respected and admired naval officer - signs on as the executive officer of the Patna, a rusty tub manned by a third-rate crew overseen by a barbarous captain, that is transporting a group of Moslem pilgrims to Mecca. During a severe storm that causes the unseaworthy ship to founder, Jim abandons ship with the rest of the white crew without even lowering the other lifeboat for the passengers. The fleeing crew are prepared to swear they saw the Patna sink with all its passengers; however, in what Jim believes is a cosmic joke upon himself, it is revealed when they get into port on their lifeboat that the Patma did not sink but had been salvaged by a French vessel. In the ensuing inquiry that he himself sought to do penance for his sins (the ultimate sin for a naval officer being to abandon ship particularly when passengers or crew are still on-board), Jim is admonished after confessing his cowardice, chastised for bringing shame upon those to whom he belongs, the British merchant marine. His chief judge asks him why he did not bury himself 20 feet deep rather than seek the inquiry and humiliate himself and all professional British sailors. Jim does succeed in burying himself 20 feet deep by becoming a drifter and common laborer in various southeast Asian ports, though he never can completely escape into anonymity. The burden of his sin follows him everywhere. Racked by guilt over abandoning his ship, the proud Jim seeks atonement, a second chance, which comes in the guise of running arms and gunpowder to a tribe of indigenous peoples oppressed by a ruthless and brutal warlord. The warlord knows that the difference between a hero and a coward is not as thick as a piece of paper.

The award winning Free China: The Courage To Believe tells the story of a mother and former Communist Party member, Jennifer Zeng, who along with more than 70 Million Chinese were practicing a belief that combined Buddhism and Daoism until the Chinese Government outlawed it. The Internet police intercepted an email and Jennifer was imprisoned for her faith. As she endured physical and mental torture, she had to decide: does she stand her ground and languish in jail, or does she recant her belief so she can tell her story to the world and be reunited with her family? A world away, Dr. Charles Lee, a Chinese American businessman, wanted to do his part to stop the persecution by attempting to broadcast uncensored information on state controlled television. He was arrested in China and sentenced to three years of re-education in a prison camp where he endured forced labor, making amongst other things, Homer Simpson slippers sold at stores throughout the US.

The film industry of each country has characteristics peculiar to their culture. That is what distinguishes them, makes them intriguing and anecdotes associated with each industry in a specific cultural context naturally lend themselves to interesting tales. The story of Baby Kusum is such an intriguing and horrifying tale. It is a story about life imitating art in a grotesque and bizarre way. This film seeks to probe into the mechanism that operates behind the creation of dreams. It highlights a phenomenon that was peculiar and exclusive to the Indian film industry--- the practise of casting children in roles opposite to their natural genders. We have had many instances of young girls being cast as boys in films and vice versa. Their screen names used to be changed to suit the gender they were playing on screen. Interestingly, in Raja Harishchandra, the first narrative film made in India, a man portrayed the heroines role. It was a common practice in Indian theatre till the middle half of the last century, to cast men in womens roles. In cinema however, verisimilitude was sought to a greater degree and hence the entire persona of the performer had to be changed to suit the screen image. It is difficult to ascertain gender of children by their appearance. Their clothes and hairdos often demarcate them. So the practice of casting perky kids, who could deliver effortless performances, in roles that were not representing their own gender, was widely practiced in Indian films. This film purports to delve into the psyche of one such person who was forced to assume a gender role other than his natural gender and analyses the disastrous consequences that follow and destroy him in his adulthood. Baby Kusum is the story of a boy burdened with a sexual identity not his own. It is about the brutality of a society that imposes superficial gender codes. It is a story of human suffering and about the tragedy of human predicament. The film tries to explore the complex maze of relationships: the Oedipal, the homosexual, the exploitative. It tears that veil of shame that covers the face of this glamorous profession. Truth stares naked at the face of an audience bred on and allured by the sham of this life. Baby Kusum explores various spaces--- the real space, the mind space, the sexual space and the spiritual space. All stand juxtaposed together and often are intermingled to create panoply of gore and blood, of intensity and brutality, of love and shame. Cinematically it confronts the time space continuum. It conjures and jumbles up the time past, the time present and the time operative, all together within the same mental space. It creates a delusion. It provokes and raises several pertinent questions. But it never ignores basic human emotions. That is where it becomes a moral fable, a pious tale. That is where it connects to the common man.", "language": "Hindi", "country": "India", "awards": "N/A", "poster": "N/A", "metascore": "N/A", "imdbrating": "4.4", "imdbvotes": "104", "imdbid": "tt1124386", "typeClass": "movie", "response": "True"}

Men were subject to harsh labor and kept from traditional hunting; whereas women had to serve the Japanese policemen and their families by doing the household work and giving up their traditional weaving work. Above all, they were forbidden to tattoo their faces. And these tattoos were seen as the Seediqs traditional belief to transform themselves into Seediq Bale (true humans). Mona Rudao, the protagonist, witnessed the repression by the Japanese over a period of 30 years. Sometime between autumn and winter 1930, when the slave labor is at its harshest, a young Seediq couple are married and a joyful party is thrown. At the same time, a newly appointed Japanese policeman goes on his inspection tour to this tribe. Mona Rudaos first son, Tado Mona, offers wine to the policeman with gusto, but is in return beaten up because his hands were considered not clean enough. With anger, Tado Mona and his brother Baso Mona attack the policeman. And from that day onward, their tribe is living in the shadow of being the object of revenge by the Japanese. In a few days, a group of youth surround Mona Rudao. They strongly request him to lead the retaliation against the Japanese. Mona Rudao struggles for a long time between extending his fellows lives and fighting back for dignity, until he sees these youngsters faces - clear without Seediqs tattoos - that he made up his mind. He tells the youngsters, Japanese troops out-number the stones in Dakusui River, more intensive than the leaves in the forest, but my determination fighting them is ever stronger than Mt. Kire. Children! On the tip of the Rainbow Bridge led to home of our ancestors spirits, there is another beautiful hunting range. Our ancestors are all there! Remember, only brave spirits can enter this place, and we can never lose it. My fellows, let us hunt the heads of our enemies, and we wash our spirits with blood so that we walk the Rainbow Bridge to be always with our ancestors. The film Seediq Bale depicts the Wushe Incident, which occurred in central Taiwan during the Japanese rule. When the Seediq Bale, believing in the Rainbow, and the Japanese, believing in the Sun, met one another, they fought. The leader of Seediq Bale, Mona Rudao, led 300 warriors fighting against 3000 Japanese troopers.

Filmed in France and selected as the French entry in the San Francisco Film Festival, Melvins film was awarded the top prize. Saying it was controversial would be an understatement. In 1968 for a black man to walk up to the podium and accept the top festival award for a film he had to go abroad to make--now thats how you make your mark. After his comedy, Watermelon Man, Melvin was determined to push the Hollywood boundaries with the groundbreaking, and even more controversial, Sweet Sweetbacks Baadasssss Song. Turned down by every major studio including Columbia, where he had a three-picture deal, Melvin was forced to basically self-finance. Risking everything he had Melvin delivered to the world the first Black Ghetto hero on the big screen--whether they were ready or not! More than 30 years later, history is being fashioned again in the telling of this very tale. Mario Van Peebles, Melvins son, directs an honest and revealing portrait of his pioneering father. Mario now tells the story of the making of Melvin Van Peebles landmark 1971 film, Sweet Sweetbacks Baadasssss Song, including Melvins struggles to raise money to fund the film under the guise of creating a black porno film. Melvin had ducked creditors, the unions and had to bail out his camera crew after they were arrested because a white cop decided a bunch of Negroes and hippies couldnt have come by that camera equipment honestly. Despite death threats and temporarily losing sight in one eye, Melvin somehow managed to whip into shape a rag-tag, multi-racial crew and finish the film that would give birth to birth of a new era which was about to explode: Independent Black Cinema.", "language": "English", "country": "USA", "awards": "4 wins & 9 nominations.", "poster": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzMzIzOTQwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM3NTUyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "metascore": "75", "imdbrating": "7.4", "imdbvotes": "4,259", "imdbid": "tt0367790", "typeClass": "movie", "response": "True"}

While dressing, Jeff is informed that his estranged wife is returning from Paris agreeable to a divorce for a big cash settlement. The price is too high and Jeff decides to fight it.

In her grief, Marjorie takes up with a dissolute wastrel, Johnny, who takes her to a roadhouse. Blondie calls Jeff and tells him that this date surely means trouble for Marjorie.

Retold with the use of intricately hand-drawn paper puppets and miniature sets, and without the use of CGI effects, this unusual travelogue takes viewers on a tour of hell. And what we find there, looks a lot like the modern world. Sporting a hoodie and a hang-over from the previous nights debauchery, Dante wakes to find he is lost - physically and metaphorically - in a strange part of town. He asks the first guy he sees for some help: The ancient Roman poet Virgil, wearing a mullet and what looks like a brown bathrobe. Having no one else to turn to, Dantes quickly convinced that his only means for survival is to follow Virgil voyage down, down through the depths of Hell. The pair cross into the underworld and there Virgil shows Dante the underbelly of the Inferno, which closely resembles the decayed landscape of modern urban life. Dante and Virgils chronicles are set against a familiar backdrop of used car lots, strip malls, gated communities, airport security checks, and the U.S. Capitol. Here, hot tubs simmer with sinners, and the river Styx is engorged with sewage swimmers. Also familiar is the contemporary cast of presidents, politicians, popes and pop-culture icons sentenced to eternal suffering of the most cruel and unusual kind: Heads sewn on backwards, bodies wrenched in half, never-ending blow jobs, dancing to techno for eternity, and last, but certainly not least, an inside look at Lucifer himself, from the point of view of a fondue-dunked human appetizer. Each creatively horrific penance suits the crime, and the soul who perpetrated it. As Dante spirals through the nine circles of hell, he comes to understand the underworlds merciless machinery of punishment, emerging a new man destined to change the course of his life. But not, of course, the brand of his beer.", "language": "English", "country": "USA", "awards": "1 win.", "poster": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MjU3MjgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI5MTkzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "metascore": "N/A", "imdbrating": "6.6", "imdbvotes": "1,300", "imdbid": "tt0479008", "typeClass": "movie", "response": "True"}

Apparently her phobia extends to the touch of any man. Alonzo feeds her fears in the hopes that Nanon will fall in love with him since he is armless. Because Zanzi discovers Alonzo really has arms, Alonzo kills him, but Nanon witnesses the killing without seeing Alonzos face; however, she does see the telltale deformity of his left hand. As Alonzo continues to plot to steal Nanon away from Mirabar, Cojo makes him realize that she will hate him once she discovers he has arms---and the deformity showing that he is her fathers murderer. Alonzo decides to have his left arm amputated, which he succeeds in doing through blackmailing a surgeon. He thinks Nanon will forgive him for hiding the fact that he has ONE arm. While Alonzo is recuperating from the surgery, Nanon gets over her fear of being touched and falls completely in love with Mirabar.

In one six-day period, there were twenty-four abductions, leading many to hire bodyguards for their children. Into this world enters John Creasy, a burned-out ex-CIA operative/assassin, who has given up on life. Creasys friend Rayburn brings him to Mexico City to be a bodyguard to nine-year-old Pita Ramos, daughter of industrialist Samuel Ramos and his wife Lisa. Creasy is not interested in being a bodyguard, especially to a youngster, but for lack of something better to do, he accepts the assignment. Creasy barely tolerates the precocious child and her pestering questions about him and his life.

Upon their arrival they find Uncle Jim and Sarah are just planning a trip to Europe and the timely arrival of Charley renders it unnecessary to close up the home as he is placed in full charge with faithful Pete as his assistant and Jim and Sarah are off for the other side. Charles repairs to the race track and donates the remaining fragments of his bank roll, to the other mans better judgment. Pete hits upon a plan to open the palatial home of the uncle as a sanitarium and thus collect a few of the shining shekels that health seekers are always anxious to let loose of. Accordingly an ad is inserted in the daily papers, a sign put over the door, and the rooms are all numbered in regular order, per city hotel fashion. The patients begin to flock in like children to a nickel show. All sorts, ages, sizes, suffering from every known and unknown malady from Reno-it is to raving maniac. Pete was collecting in advance and the place in a few short hours looked more like a castle garden of Blackville Island than a country home. The money was rolling in so fast that Chas. and Pete almost went into hysteria. Just then a telegram arrives from Frisco from Uncle Jim saying that Aunt Sarah had lost her necklace and was returning home that night to find it. To clear the house for her coming was no small job and they encounter all kinds of trouble, compelled to return their money, which has a telling effect on Charles ambitions.
